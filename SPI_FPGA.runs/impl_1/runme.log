Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC PDCN-1569] LUT equation term check: Used physical LUT pin 'A3' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1/I0) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6+~A6)*((A2))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net inst_spi/next_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin inst_spi/next_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell inst_spi/next_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net inst_uart/next_reg[1]_i_2__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin inst_uart/next_reg[1]_i_2__0/O, cell inst_uart/next_reg[1]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net next_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin next_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell next_reg[7]_i_2.
